# workDayScheduler

Goal: to create a web application that a user can update hour to hour for the work day

The planner itself will be a grid with 9 different rows 
- at the top of the page, the user will see the current date and day
- there will be 9 rows delineating hours from 9am to 5pm
- the user will be able to input their appointments into each row
- the past hours will have the standard grey background
- the current hour will have a red color
- the future hours will have a green color
- a button on the side of each hour will allow you to save an appointment 

I wanted to create an app that used Local Storage to save multiple key:value pairs.  This proved troublesome at first, but I was able to eventually save each different input to Local Storage.  Refreshing the page will not erase the user's saved data from the screen to ensure complete functionality.  Overall, this was a challenge but an enjoyable exercise.

Here is a link to my [deployed app](https://swong1200.github.io/workDayScheduler/).
