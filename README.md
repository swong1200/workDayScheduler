# workDayScheduler

Make a header with the title plus a date that changes to reflect the current date
- title will be an h1
- maybe a simple motto describing what the planner does
- an h3 or a p that changes according to the day(How do I code it so that the day changes?)

The planner itself will be a grid with 9 different rows (Use Bootstrap)
- there will be 9 rows delineating hours from 9am to 5pm
- the past hours will have the standard grey background
- the current hour will have a red color
- the future hours will have a green color
- a button on the side of each hour will allow you to save an appointment to local storage 
user writes inside input - made this an input; THIS WORKS
user presses button on side - hover class from css shows you can click this; trying to add functionality right now:

1. I need to refer to the data value of both the button and the input
2. If the two match, the button click will save what was typed to local storage

don't allow the form to update
the input will be added to the field and saved
if the user types something in the field the text will disappear but it won't be erased until the user pushes the button


- each row is a field input that you can type in when you click on it
