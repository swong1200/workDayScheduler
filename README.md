# workDayScheduler

Make a header with the title plus a date that changes to reflect the current date
- title will be an h1
- maybe a simple motto describing what the planner does
- an h3 or a p that changes according to the day(How do I code it so that the day changes?)

The planner itself will be a grid with 9 different rows (Use Bootstrap)
- there will be 9 rows delineating hours from 9am to 5pm
- the past hours will have the standard grey background
- the current hour will have a loud noticeable color
- the future hours will have a green color
- a button on the side of each hour will allow you to save an appointment to local storage (this will probably be complicated; work on this last)
- clicking on the specific hour will highlight it somehow
- each row is a field input that you can type in when you click on it
